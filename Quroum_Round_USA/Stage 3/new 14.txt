Being part of an employee-owned company means that
we all share the same fundamental core values and are willing to put the work in to ensure the shared success and stability of a business in today’s climate.

One big positive in
Quorum is the Employee-Ownership. We each own an equal share of the enterprise – this makes for a very positive environment. Everyone wants to help.

Employee-Ownership was
a new concept to me as I
joined Quorum. Straight away
I could tell the company culture was strong and Employee-Ownership bolsters this with the knowledge that we all have a say in key decisions and that we can benefit directly from company
successes as we continue to grow.

I’m a huge advocate of Employee Ownership and believe it helps ensure that Quorum remains a company that each and every one of us can rely upon in a rapidly changing world.
